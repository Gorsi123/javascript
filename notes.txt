nodejs - runtime environment
can have environment in github 
const 
let local scope like in cpp
var global scope
console.table([a,b]); undefined if not defined
use strict(for newer version of js)
alert()// in browser its defined but nodejs doesnt execute as it is
datatypes:- number,string,bigint(), string, boolean, null, undefined
typeof null => object
typeof undefined => undefined

typescript-people uses because it have strict checks like in conversions
let a=Number(b)
"123"=123, "126e71t6"=NaN, true=1, false=0
let a=Boolean(b)
"qv"=true, ""=false, 12=true, 0=false
let a=String(b)
33="33", 
Primitives datatypes (uses stack)- which are not used by reference//number,string,boolean, null,undefined, symbol, bigint
non primitives(reference)(uses heap) /objects,array,functions
string interpolation-> string with `` 
Rest operator:- in function(...nums) it takes any number of parameters in the function ans treat it as array
hoisting:- when a function is defined in a var it cant be accessed above the definition but if its just a function then it can be accessed before definition
if this is referenced in global in browser then it will refer to window object but if it is in node then this will be a empty object
implicit return=> const func=(num1,num2)=> num1+num2// no need to type the word return
